# Shopping-Cart-Clothing-Store
This is a simple React shopping cart application that allows users to add available items to their cart and displays the available stock count for each item. The application uses React.useState to keep track of the available stock and the items in the cart.

Improvements:

Displaying an error message when a user attempts to add an item to their cart that is out of stock, rather than simply doing nothing.
Adding a feature that allows users to remove items from their cart, which would require updating the stock count for that item in the available items list.
